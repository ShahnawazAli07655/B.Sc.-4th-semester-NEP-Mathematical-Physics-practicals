## Experiment 1: Solution of Differential Equation  
**File:** `Exp 1 scilab diff eqn.sci`

### Aim  
To solve the following differential equations:  
(i)
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x,\quad y = 0 \text{ for } x = 0
$$

(ii)
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + e^{-x}y = x^2
$$

(iii)
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx} = -y
$$

(iv)
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + e^{-x}\frac{dy}{dx} = -y
$$

### Theory  
Differential equations play a central role in physics as they describe the evolution
of physical systems. Many problems in mechanics, electricity, and quantum physics
are governed by ordinary differential equations.

### Learning Outcome  
Students learn how to solve differential equations numerically using Scilab.

## Experiment 2: Matrix Multiplication  
**File:** `Exp 2 Matrix multiply.sci`

### Aim  
To perform the multiplication of two \( 3 \times 3 \) matrices.

### Theory  
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is widely used
in physics for solving systems of equations, coordinate transformations, and operator
methods.

### Learning Outcome  
Students learn basic matrix operations and their implementation in Scilab.

---

## Experiment 3: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Matrix  
**File:** `Exp 3 matrix eigen.sci`

### Aim  
To compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrices.

### Theory  
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in many areas of physics such as
quantum mechanics, vibrations, and normal mode analysis.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand diagonalization and physical significance of eigenvalues.

---

## Experiment 8: n-th Roots of a Complex Number  
**File:** `Exp 8 nthroot all .sci`

### Aim  
To compute the n-th roots of unity for \( n = 2, 3 \) and \( 4 \).

### Theory  
Using polar form and De Moivre’s theorem, the roots of complex numbers can be obtained
systematically and represented in the complex plane.

### Learning Outcome  
Students visualize complex roots and understand their geometric distribution.

---

## Experiment 9: Square Root of a Complex Number  
**File:** `Exp 9 Sqrt of 5 12i.sci`

### Aim  
To find the two square roots of the complex number \( 5 + 12i \).

### Theory  
The square root of a complex number can be calculated using algebraic or polar form,
leading to two distinct solutions.

### Learning Outcome  
Students gain confidence in complex number arithmetic and interpretation.
