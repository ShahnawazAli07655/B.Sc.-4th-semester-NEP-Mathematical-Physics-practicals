## Experiment 2: Matrix Multiplication  
**File:** `Exp 2 Matrix multiply.sci`

### Aim  
To perform multiplication of matrices using Scilab.

### Theory  
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is widely used
in physics for solving systems of equations, coordinate transformations, and operator
methods.

### Learning Outcome

## Experiment 3: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Matrix  
**File:** `Exp 3 matrix eigen.sci`

### Aim  
To compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given matrix using Scilab.

### Theory  
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in many areas of physics such as
quantum mechanics, vibrations, and normal mode analysis.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand diagonalization and physical significance of eigenvalues.

## Experiment 8: n-th Roots of a Complex Number  
**File:** `Exp 8 nthroot all .sci`

### Aim  
To find all n-th roots of a given complex number.

### Theory  
Using polar form and De Moivre’s theorem, the roots of complex numbers can be obtained
systematically and represented in the complex plane.

### Learning Outcome  
Students visualize complex roots and understand their geometric distribution.

---

## Experiment 9: Square Root of a Complex Number  
**File:** `Exp 9 Sqrt of 5 12i.sci`

### Aim  
To compute the square root of a complex number using Scilab.

### Theory  
The square root of a complex number can be calculated using algebraic or polar form,
leading to two distinct solutions.

### Learning Outcome  
Students gain confidence in complex number arithmetic and interpretation.
